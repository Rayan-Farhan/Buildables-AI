    "\n",
    "The internet‚Äîoften called simply ‚Äúthe net‚Äù‚Äîis one of the most influential inventions of the modern age. What began as a small research project in the late 20th century has grown into a vast, interconnected network that links billions of people, devices, and systems worldwide. Today, it is hard to imagine a single day without it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Brief History\n",
    "\n",
    "The origins of the internet trace back to the 1960s, when ARPANET was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense as a way to share information across computers. By the 1990s, the World Wide Web and web browsers made the internet accessible to everyday users, opening the door to email, search engines, and e-commerce.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Internet in Daily Life\n",
    "\n",
    "From checking news updates to ordering food, the internet has woven itself into nearly every aspect of our routines. Students use it for learning, professionals rely on it for remote work, and families use it to stay connected across continents. Social media platforms, video calls, and instant messaging have replaced many traditional forms of communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business and Innovation\n",
    "\n",
    "The net is not only a communication tool‚Äîit is also a driver of global commerce. Companies use online platforms to market products, provide customer service, and sell directly to consumers. Entire industries such as e-commerce, digital marketing, and cloud computing have emerged thanks to the internet. Startups, in particular, thrive because the net lowers barriers to entry, enabling innovation at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges and Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its benefits, the internet comes with challenges. Cybersecurity threats, misinformation, and privacy concerns are ongoing issues. Governments and organizations must work together to create safer online spaces without restricting freedom of expression. Additionally, the digital divide‚Äîthe gap between those with internet access and those without‚Äîremains a pressing concern, particularly in developing countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Future of the Net\n",
    "\n",
    "As technologies such as artificial intelligence, 5G, and the Internet of Things (IoT) evolve, the net will continue to expand in scope and impact. Smart homes, connected cars, and advanced healthcare systems are just the beginning. The challenge will be balancing innovation with responsibility, ensuring the internet remains a tool for progress and inclusivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The internet has reshaped human life in ways once thought impossible. It connects people, fuels economies, and opens doors to knowledge. While challenges remain, its role as a cornerstone of modern civilization is undeniable. The future promises even greater transformations‚Äîmaking the net one of humanity‚Äôs most powerful tools."

    "### **Task 1: Reflection Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) How is prompt chaining similar to solving a jigsaw puzzle?\n",
    "Prompt chaining breaks a big problem into many small, connected pieces. Each prompt produces one piece. You then connect those pieces and the output of one becomes the input for the next, until the full picture emerges. Like a puzzle, small pieces are easier to place and verify than trying to assemble the whole at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) What‚Äôs the main difference between iteration and chaining?\n",
    "Iteration = keep rewording or tweaking a single prompt to get a better single response.\n",
    "Chaining = run a sequence of targeted prompts where each builds on the previous output to accomplish a multi-step task.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Why might chaining be more effective than asking AI one big question?\n",
    "Because large, complex tasks contain multiple subproblems (search, filter, synthesize, validate). A single prompt can overload the model or produce unfocused output. Chaining reduces cognitive load per step, preserves structure, makes errors easier to catch, and gives you checkpoints to verify before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) How can the context window of an AI model affect your chaining strategy?\n",
    "Models can ‚Äúremember‚Äù only so much. If your chain produces long outputs, you must either summarize intermediate outputs before passing them on, or store large outputs externally and pass links/keys, or chunk the chain so each step stays within the context window."
