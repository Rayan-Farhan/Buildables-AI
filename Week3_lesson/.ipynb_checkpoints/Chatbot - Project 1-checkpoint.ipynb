    "### **Step 1 - Use Case:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Freelancer Project Assistant Bot is a chat assistant that helps freelancers (designers, developers, writers, marketers) quickly draft proposals, client emails, project timelines, and follow-up messages. I picked this because freelancers lose hours to admin work; automating high-quality, consistent text (proposals, scope docs, timelines) and quick project planning saves time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target users & expected benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Who: independent freelancers, solo consultants, small studio owners.\n",
    "* Benefits: faster proposal creation, polished client communication, instant timeline/milestone drafts, consistent scopes and pricing templates, fewer missed follow-ups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations (what it cannot do):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cannot legally/financially sign or finalize contracts (only draft language).\n",
    "* Won’t replace domain expertise for highly niche technical specs without user-provided detail.\n",
    "* No automatic project execution.\n",
    "* Output quality depends on user inputs; wrong/missing input will lead to poor draft."

    "\n",
    "**Why is this problem worth solving with a chatbot?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Freelancers’ time is expensive; repetitive admin (drafts, emails, timelines) distracts from billable work. A well-built chatbot reduces friction, accelerates client-facing work, and standardizes quality; so a clear ROI for freelancers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does a chatbot improve the experience vs website/app/human support?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Faster, interactive drafting versus filling static forms on a site.\n",
    "* More adaptive than templates — it tailors text to project details in seconds.\n",
    "* Cheaper and instant compared to hiring a VA; accessible 24/7.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What specific tasks will the chatbot perform?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Draft full project proposals (scope, deliverables, timeline, payment terms).\n",
    "2. Create client emails (intro, update, follow-up).\n",
    "3. Produce milestone-based timelines and simple task breakdowns.\n",
    "4. Generate brief quotes and budget breakdowns.\n",
    "5. Provide short editing/refinement (shorten, formalize, casual tone).\n",
    "6. Suggest follow-up checklists and reminders (session-scoped)."

    "* **Language support:** Primarily English. If we need multilingual support later, we can test `mixtral-8x7b` for stronger multilingual competency or add a small translation pipeline.\n",

    "### **Step 5 - Choose a Prompting Technique**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Techniques used:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **System Prompt Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * I set the role/persona of the bot as *“Freelancer Assistant Bot”* with explicit rules about tone, structure, clarifications, and privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Few-Shot Prompting**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * I included two worked examples (a proposal and a status email).\n",
    "   * These examples teach the model the exact style and structure expected (headings, bullet points, timelines, payment terms, email-ready summaries).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Zero-Shot Prompting (at runtime)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * When the user gives new requests (e.g., *“make it semi-formal with humor”*), the model handles them directly without examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why These Were the Best Choices?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **System Prompt Design** ensures the bot always behaves professionally and consistently, which is critical in freelancer–client communication.\n",
    "* **Few-Shot Prompting** was chosen because proposals and updates must follow a predictable template. Few-shots train the model on the structure so every output looks professional and standardized.\n",
    "* **Zero-Shot Prompting** gives flexibility so users can make adjustments (tone changes, shortening, humor injection) without overloading the system prompt with too many examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination was the best because it balances structure (few-shot + system prompt) with flexibility (zero-shot instructions), making the bot reliable and also adaptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prompt template\n",
    "\n",
    "*SYSTEM_PROMPT*:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are \"Freelancer Assistant Bot\" — a professional, concise, and helpful project assistant for independent freelancers.\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "- Always produce clear, structured outputs with headings and bullets when generating proposals, timelines, or emails.\n",
    "- Ask clarifying questions if required project details (budget, deadline, scope) are missing.\n",
    "- Keep tone professional by default; honor user requests to make tone \"casual\", \"friendly\", or \"formal\".\n",
    "- When asked to \"shorten\" or \"email-format\", produce both a full draft and a 2-3 sentence email-ready summary.\n",
    "- If user requests step-by-step reasoning (e.g., cost breakdown), label it \"Reasoning\" and show numbered steps.\n",
    "- If user asks for saved templates, offer to label the template and confirm storage (consent required).\n",
    "- Respect user privacy; do not store data persistently unless user confirms.\n",

    "- Always produce clear, structured outputs with headings and bullets when generating proposals, timelines, or emails.\n",
    "- Ask clarifying questions if required project details (budget, deadline, scope) are missing.\n",
    "- Keep tone professional by default; honor user requests to make tone \"casual\", \"friendly\", or \"formal\".\n",
    "- When asked to \"shorten\" or \"email-format\", produce both a full draft and a 2-3 sentence email-ready summary.\n",
    "- If user requests step-by-step reasoning (e.g., cost breakdown), label it \"Reasoning\" and show numbered steps.\n",
    "- If user asks for saved templates, offer to label the template and confirm storage (consent required).\n",
    "- Respect user privacy; do not store data persistently unless user confirms.\n",
