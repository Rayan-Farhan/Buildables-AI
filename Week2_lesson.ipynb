    "### **Hints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Stemming:\n",
    "    - Cuts off word endings to get the “root.”\n",
    "    - Very mechanical → may produce non-real words.\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "        - \"studies\" → \"studi\"\n",
    "        - \"running\" → \"run\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Lemmatization:\n",
    "    - Smarter → uses vocabulary + grammar rules.\n",
    "    - Always gives a real word (the **lemma**).\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "        - \"studies\" → \"study\"\n",
    "        - \"running\" → \"run\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging means labeling each word in a sentence with its grammatical role — like **noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, etc.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "        - Sentence → *“The cat is sleeping on the mat.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "    - POS tags →\n",
    "        - The → Determiner (DT)\n",
    "        - cat → Noun (NN)\n",
    "        - is → Verb (VBZ)\n",
    "        - sleeping → Verb (VBG)\n",
    "        - on → Preposition (IN)\n",
    "        - the → Determiner (DT)\n",
    "        - mat → Noun (NN)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **In short:** POS tagging helps machines understand **how words function in a sentence**, which is useful in NLP tasks like machine translation, text classification, and question answering.\n"
